These examples demonstrate different control structures in Matlab:
if-else, for loops, while loops, try-catch, and case-switch. They include
using input() to get a user-provided parameter, mod() to get the remainder
when a number is divided by another, randperm() to randomly permute a
set of integers, exp() to compute Euler's exponential function, and
tic/toc to time a code fragment. 

------------------
for-loop examples 
------------------
loops1.m: the basic single loop
loops2.m: using it to show the sequence of plots for sine frequencies
loops3.m: the values in the index array can be in any order
loops4.m: demonstrates nested loops, and preallocation of arrays
loops5.m: verify that the double nested loops matched the ij-matrix

-------------------
while-loop examples
-------------------
whiles1.m: basic while loop info
whiles2.m: testing the Collatz conjecture with a while loop
whiles3.m: a better Collatz checker
whiles4.m: a Collatz checker that tests its input value for common errors

trycatch.m: examples of a try-catch control structure
